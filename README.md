 ## What is a cutscene?
 A cutscene is a scene in a videogame that may no be interactive, develops the storyline and is shown when a certain event occurs.
 ## When do we use it?
 **1. Intro**: The initial cutscene in games is the iniTial movie. It introduces the player to the universe, and shows which events lead to the actual situation of the world. There are four different ways to break down the information:
  - Plot: It gives to the player lots of details and information about how he/she get there and what is about to encounter. Example: Command & Conquer

  - Back-story: The game explains a little story which tolds the player the motivation of the good and the bad guys. Example: Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Myth

  - Action: It shows examples how the basic gameplay is going to be. Example: Mech Warrior 2

  - Mood: The most effective way to setting a stage is by establishing the mood for the game. It would grant the player attention. Example: Diablo, Kingdom Hearts.

  **2. In-between**: The purpose of this can be a reward or a way to advance the plot. The custscene as a reward gives the player times to rest from the previous level and prepare for the next one. Advancing the plot gives a clue of what is going to happen next. Usually this elements are combined. Examples: The Last of Us, Uncharted, Kingdom Hearts, Professor Layton, etc.

**3. Final**: The final cutscene has to be the best of the game. The player has to feel that all the effort was worth it and that she/he has recieved the final reward. Adding a couple of alternate endings will make the game replayable. Example: Bioshock

In Bioshock, the player has different endings depending on the path chosen. There are two different endings, one good (where you save all the Little Sisters) and one bad (where you decide to harvest a couple or more Little Sisters).
